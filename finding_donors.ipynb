    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Question 2 Answer\n",
    "I choose Decision Trees, Support vector machines and Random Forests as my three supervised/classifcation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Decision Trees**\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are really good for app recommendations for users. Given some info on the user, such as age, occupation, gender, we can predict them an app. \n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires less data cleaning, as we don't need to normalize or scale the data. It is good with classification problems like this. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "It usually takes longer, and is more expensive in complexity and time (if the data is vast) then compared to other models. Also, it can't do regression or to predict any continuous values. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classification problem, which decision trees are good with. Also, it is very good at determining the impact of each feature in the data, and how likely it results with the prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is good with classification problems like this. For example, it can be used to check if a candidate is applicable for a loan based on info about him. \n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good with classification problems. They are very accurate in higher dimensions (like this problem). Also, they use a subset of training points, instead of everything as Logistic Regression does. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is prone to overfitting. Also, unlike logistic regression, it does not provide probability estimates. Also, it's not that efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classification problem, and there are tons of features thus the data will be in multiple dimensions, something SVMs are good with. Also, we don't need the probability if they have more then 50k in income, we care about a binary yes or no. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Random Forests (Ensemble Methods)**\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests are good for app recommendations for users. Given some info on the user, such as age, occupation, gender, we can predict them an app. \n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "They make a bunch of a particular model, each trained on a subset of the data. Then they all vote. As it merges different models, it can create a supermodel. They are also used to increase performance models. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more complex, as you are creating a bunch of models. Even though they train fast, they are slow to create predictions. As accurate ensembles require more trees, it takes more memory and becomes slower. It's not good for large data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Foresting is just taking a bunch of trees then combining to make a more accurate model. Also as the data isn't too large, it will be fine to make multiple different trees. "

    "I focused on looking at the graphs for the testing set, which is bottom right. I didn't look much at f-score for training because it could be overfitting. Looking at the 100% training set sample (for F-score testing), I see that SVC and RandomForesting are identical. DecisionTreee lagged behind both SVC and random foresting for each training set size. However, SVC took a long time to train, while random foresting was significantly less, and Decision tree almost instant. Because Random foresting took less time to train and has an f-score nearly identical to SVC, I believe that **Random Foresting did the best**. \n",

    "For starters, Random Foresting model did the best. All random foresting does, is that it makes bunch a decision tree on different columns of the data. All a decision tree is a simple if-else-elseif diagram, for example when predicting favorite colors of kids, a decision tree may just say, if the user is a girl, then the favorite color is pink, while if the user is a boy then the favorite color is blue. This is a basic example of a decision tree, to make them more complex you add more description to the if statement. \n",

    "Now random foresting takes a bunch of simple decision trees, who does their if statement description based on different columns. So one tree may say, if the user is married, then they make more than 50k, if single they make less. Now that we have a bunch of trees, random foresting askes all the models to predict if a particular user is making more than 50k. Then all the models predict. If the majority of the models said more than 50k, then the final prediction will be the user makes more than 50k. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The reduced data did have less accuracy and F-score than when we used the full data, but the difference was minor. The reduced data had approximately 0.01 and 0.03 less accuracy and f-score, respectably compared to when we used the full data. If time was a factor, I would consider using the reduced training set, as it cut down 103 features to just 5 resulting in a very little decrease of accuracy and f-score. "
